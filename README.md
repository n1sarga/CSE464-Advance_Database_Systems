# Protein Data Bank Management System

In this project, an Object-Oriented Database (OODB) schema was designed and implemented within a relational database environment. The schema includes object types representing various types of proteins, such as enzymes, antibodies, transport proteins, and hormonal proteins. These object types encapsulate attributes and methods relevant to each protein type, demonstrating concepts like inheritance and encapsulation. Nested tables are utilized to store collection attributes efficiently, while PL/SQL queries and cursors are employed to retrieve and manipulate data. The project also highlights the importance of database design considerations, such as data modeling, integrity constraints, and encapsulation of business logic within stored procedures. Overall, this project serves as a practical demonstration of applying object-oriented principles to database design and management, showcasing the flexibility and efficiency of OODB concepts within a relational database framework.
